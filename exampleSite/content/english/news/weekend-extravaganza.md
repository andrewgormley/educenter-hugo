### **All Weapons - Weekend Cup!**

We are pleased to announce that the registration for our first ever all weapons competition is now live!

The all weapons scene has been incredibly active in recent times, and has witnessed many successful competitions being held by different hosts. At vcod.gg, we are hoping to provide a platform for both communities, whilst hosting an exciting all weapons competition for all to enjoy.

Hosting an all weapons competition has been discussed multiple times, but our main focus has been to provide rifle only competitions. We are now in a position to provide something fun for the all weapons community, as well as contuining with our rifle only competitions.
