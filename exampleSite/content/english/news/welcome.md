### **Registration Opens!**

We are pleased to announce that the registration for our first competition is now live!

After taking into consideration the community size and recent competitions, we are providing a competition which we feel is right for the Call of Duty 1 community. Our first competition will include all stock Call of Duty 1 maps; please note that german town will not be included in the map pool for this competition.

If you wish to register your team for the upcoming competition, then visit our tournament page at: [https://www.vcod.gg/tournaments/vcod-ro-cup-1/](https://www.vcod.gg/tournaments/vcod-ro-cup-1/ "https://www.vcod.gg/tournaments/vcod-ro-cup-1/"). Please ensure you have read the cup information before clicking 'Apply Now'. Please only sign up if you are able and willing to complete all of your matches. We will not be accepting any teams with missing GUIDs.
