### **Registration Opens!**

We are pleased to announce that the registration for our first competition is now live!

After taking into consideration the community size and recent competitions, we are providing a competition which we feel is right for the Call of Duty 1 community. Our first competition will include all stock Call of Duty 1 maps; please note that german town will not be included in the map pool for this competition.

If you wish to register your team for the upcoming competition, then visit our tournament page at: [**vcod.gg/tournaments/vcod-ro-cup-1**](https://www.vcod.gg/tournaments/vcod-ro-cup-1/ "https://www.vcod.gg/tournaments/vcod-ro-cup-1/"). Please ensure you have read the cup information before clicking 'Apply Now'. We are asking teams to only sign up if they are able and willing to complete all of their matches. We will not be accepting any teams with missing GUIDs.

More information regarding the rules of the competition can be found at: [**vcod.gg/rules**](https://www.vcod.gg/rules/ "https://www.vcod.gg/rules/") or on our Community Discord at: [**discord.gg/FA5vxDa**](https://discord.gg/FA5vxDa. "https://discord.gg/FA5vxDa.").

We hope the community will embrace our new website and make this a cup to remember!

vCoD.gg \~ team
