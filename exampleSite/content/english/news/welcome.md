### **Registration Opens!**

We are pleased to announce that the registration for our first competition is now live!

After taking into consideration the community size and recent competitions, we are providing a competition which we feel is right for the Call of Duty 1 community. Our first competition will include all stock Call of Duty 1 maps; please note that german town will not be included in the map pool for this competition.
