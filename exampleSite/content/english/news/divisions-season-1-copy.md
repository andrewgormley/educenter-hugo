### **The vcod.gg Mix Cup!**

We are pleased to announce that the registration for our next competition is now live!

Our next competition is something new, something fresh, something exciting. The competition will be held over a weekend and will involve members from the vcod community entering into a completely random mix team!

**How will this work?**

Players will sign up as an individual and once the registration period ends, team captains will be chosen to lead and organise a completely random mix team. 

In the registration form, players will be asked to rate themselves to help the vcod.gg team place players into tiers, to ensure the competition is fair.
