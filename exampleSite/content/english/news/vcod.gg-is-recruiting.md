### **We Need You!**

With our first competition nearing closer to the finish line, it has given us chance to reflect on both the positives and negatives of our return to hosting Call of Duty 1 competitions. Whilst we are incredibly happy with the overall outcome of the competition, we are very aware of the areas we need to improve on.

Looking towards the future, a restructure is on the horizon for vcod.gg. We are looking for highly motivated individuals, who have experience with the rifles only community. The following positions are available:

* vcod.gg Cup Supervisor (1 position).
* vcod.gg Conflict Team (3 positions).
* vcod.gg Referee Team (6 positions).

If you have been a referee throughout the first competition and would like to continue being a referee, then you will also need to fill in the application form.

We wish you the best of luck with applications!
