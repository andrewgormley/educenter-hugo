### **Divisions - Season #1!**

We are pleased to announce that the registration for our next competition on Call of Duty 1 is now live! We are extremely excited about the future of vcod.gg and we think you will be too! 

After the recent success in the All Weapons scene, we are following in their footsteps with a divisions style competition. However, we have a a slight twist! 

* Tiered divisions will be decided by Cup Supervisors.
* Groups will be limited to 5 teams in Season 1.
* Matches will take place over two weekends.
* Week 1: 18th-21st September.
* You will play each team once - maps are pre-decided.
* Week 2: 2nd-5th October.
* You will play each team once - maps are pre-decided.
* In total you will play each team twice.
* Teams which finish in the 1st position will be promoted into a higher tiered division - unless you are in the diamond league.
* Teams which finish in the 5th position will be relegated into a lower tiered division - unless their is no lower active tier.
* Teams which finish in the 2nd position will play a promotion playoff match against the 4th placed team in a higher tiered division.
* Teams which finish in the 4th position will play a relegation playoff match against the 2nd placed team in a lower tiered division.
