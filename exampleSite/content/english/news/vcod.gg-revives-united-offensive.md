### **United Offensive - Reborn!**

We are pleased to announce that the registration for our vcod.gg United Offensive competition is now live!

We have been paying close attention to the comeback of the old Call of Duty games and were very excited when we heard that there was an all weapons competition being held on United Offensive.

Holding a rifles only competition on United Offensive has been in the pipeline for a while now, and with a lot of our community having played both the original vcod and United Offensive, we are confident that we can gain enough interest to host a decent competition!

Please ensure you have read the cup information before clicking ‘Apply Now’. We are asking teams to only sign up if they are able and willing to complete all of their matches. We will not be accepting any teams with missing GUIDs.
