### **vCoD.gg - Rifles Only # 1 Rules**

Here you will find the rules for our upcoming competiton. Please bear in mind, that although we are not new to hosting competitions, there may be a missing rule or a rule that is not clear. Please contact us if you find any issues with the rules via our contact page.

#### **1. General**

**1.1 – Punishment**

1\.1.1 – Players which violate any of the vCoD.gg rules are subject to punishment.

1\.1.2 – Punishment will result in receiving a card and in more serious cases, a temporary or permanent ban from all vCoD.gg competitions.

1\.1.3 – A player and/or clan can be given 2 types of card.

1\.1.31 – Yellow card: This card is given out for small rule violations and will usually be given out as a warning. However, a yellow card can still result in the result of a match being amended. A second yellow card is equivalent to a red card.

1\.1.32 – Red card: This card is given for more serious offences and will in most cases lead to a forfeit loss and punishment of the player and/or clan in question. Receiving a red card may also lead to a temporary or permanent ban from all vCoD.gg competitions.

1\.1.4 – Only one card can be given out each match. In case of several violations, only the most severe card will be issued. However, all extra punishments for each rule that was violated will still be applied.

1\.1.5 – Abusive behaviour towards a vCoD.gg admin, referee or opponent, at any time during the competition is not acceptable. If the abusive behaviour is severe then an admin has the right to punish with a temporary or permanent ban from the competition.

1\.1.6 – The clan leader is responsible for his/her own members to know, understand and follow the rules.

1\.1.7 – If a player is banned by PunkBuster during a match, the match will end immediately, and the opposing team will receive a default win. Please take a screenshot for evidence.
