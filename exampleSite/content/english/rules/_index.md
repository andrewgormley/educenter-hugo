### **vcod.gg - Rifles Only Rules**

Here you will find the rules for our upcoming competition. Please bear in mind, that although we are not new to hosting competitions, there may be a rule that is missing or a rule that is not clear. You can contact us on our contact page if you find any issues.

#### **1. General**

**1.1 – Punishment**

1\.1.1 – Players who violate any of the vcod.gg rules are subject to punishment.

1\.1.2 – Punishment will result in receiving a card and in more serious cases, a temporary or permanent ban from all vcod.gg competitions.

1\.1.3 – A player and/or clan can be given two types of card:

* 1.1.31 – Yellow card: This card is given out for small rule violations and will usually be given out as a warning. However, a yellow card can still end in the result of a match being amended. A second yellow card is equivalent to a red card.
* 1.1.32 – Red card: This card is given for more serious offences and will in most cases lead to a forfeit loss and punishment of the player and/or clan in question. Receiving a red card may also lead to a temporary or permanent ban from all vcod.gg competitions.

1\.1.4 – A player and/or clan can be given more than one card in a match. In case of several violations, only the most severe card will be issued. However, all extra punishments for each rule that was violated will still be applied.

1\.1.5 – Abusive behaviour towards a vcod.gg admin, supervisor, referee or opponent, at any time during the competition is not acceptable. If the abusive behaviour is severe, then an admin has the right to punish with a temporary or permanent ban from the competition.

1\.1.6 – The clan leader is responsible for his/her own members to know, understand and follow the rules.

1\.1.7 – If a player is banned by PunkBuster during a match, the match will end immediately, and the opposing team will receive a forfeit win; please take a screenshot for evidence.

**1.2 – Spectating**

1\.2.1 – vcod.gg reserves the right to broadcast every match.

1\.2.2 – Spectating during an official match is not allowed unless you are an official vcod.gg admin, supervisor, referee or streamer. Should any spectator join who is not allowed, the game should be immediately paused whilst the spectator is removed from the server.

1\.2.3 – Admins have the right to teamview any player during the match.

**1.3 – Arranging Matches**

1\.3.1 – Matches can be played from Monday through to the following Monday, 22:00 CET. If you cannot find an agreement with the enemy team, the match will be automatically set for the Sunday at 20:00 CET.

1\.3.2 – Matches should be arranged by sending a personal message on Discord to a clan's admin.

1\.3.3 – If a clan's admin refuses to communicate and agree on a time and date to play a match, you should contact a vcod.gg admin.

1\.3.4 – When both clans agree not to play a match, it can be cancelled for any reason after the scheduled starting time, only if the match can still be completed in the scheduled game week.

**1.4 – Before the Match**

1\.4.1 – To find your opponent before a match, you should look on the website and add them on Discord.

1\.4.2 – If you have still not managed to get in touch with your opponent 20 minutes after the scheduled starting time of the match, you can fill in a no-show.

1\.4.3 – Matches can only start if a referee is present (unless both teams agree to play without).

1\.4.4 – Players listed with an EYE will be teamviewed upon entering the game. Anyone refusing to be teamviewed will not be allowed to participate.

1\.4.5 – An admin, supervisor or referee should teamview EYE players upon entering the game. In case admins, supervisors or referees are unavailable, the opposing clan admin will be allowed to teamview their opponent's EYE players onto the server.

1\.4.6 – Before each game can start, the server admin should always ensure that both teams are ready. If one member of a team says that his team is ready, he is considered to speak for the whole team, regardless of his status in the clan.

**1.5 – After the Match**

1\.5.1 – Either clan can post the result of a match, unless the other has already done so.

1\.5.2 – Clans are expected to have proof of their match being played for one week after the score has been confirmed.

1\.5.3 – Players who participated in an official match are expected to upload their Veritas files. Failure to do so or uploading the wrong files will lead to a forfeit loss and a yellow card for the player(s) in question.

**1.6 – Leaving**

1\.6.1 – Clans which leave the competition or are removed for 2 no-shows/forfeits are likely to be excluded from future competitions.

1\.6.2 – Reconnecting during the match without any valid reason is not allowed and will result in a yellow card and forfeit of the round.

1\.6.3 – If a player drops connection because of a technical error, the match must be paused. You can call a time out by typing "/matchtimeout" in the console. A pause can only be made when a round has started or finished.

1\.6.4 – The maximum time you can pause for is 5 minutes. After this time, the match will resume. The maximum total pause time is 5 minutes per map, per team. You do not need a reason to call a time-out.

4\.1.3 – Rounds are set at 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

4\.1.4 – The first team to reach 21 rounds will be determined the winner. However, teams must play the full 40 rounds during the group stage. Not playing the full 40 rounds or trolling the remaining rounds will result in punishment.

4\.1.6 – During the group stage, the maps will be pre-chosen and will be played in the order listed on the website. Bash for side will take place before each map begins, with the winner deciding which side to start on.

4\.1.7 – During the knockout stage, teams must state their map before bash takes place. The winner of bash will then choose whose map will be played first. Bash for side will take place at the start of each map to determine sides. Clans can only choose a map once until the Grand Final, where maps will be reset.

4\.1.8 – In the event of a draw (20 - 20) during the knockout stage, a golden map will be played. Bash for side will take place with the winner starting a veto of maps. The final map left from the veto will be played as a third map. Bash for side will take place to determine sides. The first team to reach 11 rounds will be determined the winner.

4\.1.9 – In the event of a draw (10 - 10) during the golden map, the second last map banned during the veto will be played. Bash for side will take place to determine sides. The first team to reach 11 rounds will be determined the winner.

4\.2.1 –The default team size for clan matches is 5 vs 5, but you can specify a different team size if needed. The minimum team size is 4 vs 4 and the maximum team size is 6 vs 6.

4\.2.2 – Substituting a player during the match is only allowed between sides and map change, or in case of extreme connection problems during the game. If the new player has not showed up after 5 minutes the match will resume.

4\.2.3 – At map or side change, clans can take a maximum of 5 minutes for a break, the match is to resume after that time. When the 5 minutes are up, spectators can be removed freely. Staying in spectator will lead to the automatic loss of the round.

4\.2.4 – If a clan does not ready up in time after map change, it will lead to forfeiting rounds and eventually a forfeit loss for the violating clan.

4\.2.5 – In total, 8 teams will progress into the knockout stage. The top 3 from group A will automatically progress with the top 2 teams from groups B and C. The final place in the knockout stage will go to the best 3rd placed team from groups B and C.

#### **5. Demos and Screenshots**

**5.1 – Demos**

5\.1.1 – All players must record demos from the entire match. Demos can be requested as long as there is a valid reason and must be kept until the result has been accepted. Demos can be requested before a conflict is made.

* 5.1.31 – The clan must explain their reason(s) for their demo request.
* 5.1.32 – The clan must state round number(s) and time(s) within the round.

5\.1.4 – Failure to upload requested demos or uploading demos that are broken or incomplete will result in the player receiving a yellow card and the clan forfeiting the match.

5\.1.5 – A demo is considered to be incomplete if it is missing 3 or more rounds. If a clan is manipulating the demo process (e.g. by stopping it in a live match on purpose), all the points gained in that period will be awarded to the opponent.

5\.2.7 – Only screenshots can be accepted as proof when there is a dispute about the score.

#### **6. Cheating and Bug Abuse**

6\.1.2 – If both clans cheated and/or used a suspended player, the match result will be void. Players will receive a red card and a permanent ban from all vCoD.gg competitions.

6\.1.2 – All programs or files, be they changed game files or new files, that change or edit the game or add to its functionality, or that interact with the game in any way, are strictly forbidden. The use of any forbidden programs or file by any clan member leads to a forfeit loss and could lead to a removal and ban from the competition in major cases.

6\.1.3 – Modified versions of the game's resource files are always forbidden, regardless of what they do. The use of any forbidden program or file by any clan member during a match leads to a forfeit loss and could lead to a removal and ban from the competition in major cases.

6\.1.4 – Config settings that give a distinct advantage over the opponent may be deemed config abuse and can lead to the player receiving a yellow card and forfeit of the match.

6\.1.5 – When providing timestamps for demos, remember to state which player's demo and what map you are referring to. The round indication should be clear for everyone to be able to follow. If the match was interrupted by a map restart (for example because of a pause) or similar and the round ordering has changed, be sure to mark those to make everything clear. Every timestamp must be exact, saying "watch demo" or "whole round" are unacceptable and will not be taken into consideration while watching the demo.

**6.2 – Bug Abuse**

6\.2.1 – It is not allowed to take advantage of or abuse bugs. Any kind of bug abuse is considered cheating and will result in forfeiting the round where the bug was abused, unless otherwise mentioned specifically in the rules. Bug abuse consists of:

6\.2.2 – Any types of scripts proven to give a real advantage or are part of the not allowed binds/scripts below, will not be tolerated and will result in the player receiving a yellow card and the clan forfeiting the match. Disallowed binds and scripts are:

* 6.2.21 – Any 'exec' or 'vstr' bind (this does not include anything related to demos or demo players).
* 6.2.22 – Any 'cmdcur' bind.
* 6.2.23 – Any script including 'lookdown'.
* 6.2.24 – Any bind including 'rate' cannot have a value outside 25000.

* 6.2.28 – Any bind including 'left' or 'right' cannot be combined with other commands.

6\.2.3 – All binds/scripts that are not covered above will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to see if they do give an advantage.

6\.2.4 – Any abuse of the two monitor bug will be reviewed case-by-case by the cup admin, supervisors and conflict team. You should avoid using this bug at all costs, as it may result in the player receiving a yellow card and the clan forfeiting the match.

**6.3 – Match Conflicts**

6\.3.1 – The match conflict system functions as a court room with vCoD.gg admin, supervisors and conflict team acting as judges. A match conflict can be made when the result entered by one clan is not accepted by the other.

6\.3.2 – In the conflict, both sides must explain the problem in a short but clear and complete way. Both sides should state the match result they claim, and only relevant and proven facts may be mentioned.

6\.3.3 – All proof and information on the match should be written to the result page.

6\.3.4 – Examples of valid proof are: demos, in-game screenshots and server logs that were obtained from a neutral party. If a demo is used as proof of cheating or other malicious actions, you must specify the exact moment(s) (down to the exact minute and second) where the cheating occurred, or you will get a conflict loss. Supervisors will not look at entire demos.

6\.3.5 – If a clan does not give any new relevant information within 2 days (48 hours) since the last reply, it will be considered they have nothing more to add.
