### **Cup Information**

Rifles Only Community, we are back!

We are pleased to announce that the registration for our first installment (yes, there will be more) of the latest vCoD.gg competitions will be going live on the 18th of May. Please find the registration form below.

**Date:** 2nd of May (Saturday) & 3rd of May (Sunday)

**Time:** 2pm UK Time (3pm CET) start on both days

**Anti-cheat:** Veritas-AC

**Teams:** 16 (capped, first come first served)

**Group Format:** 4 groups of 4. Top 2 go qualify for the main event (double elim) and bottom 2 qualify for the plate event (double elim).

**Group Qualification:** Points -> Rounds Difference -> Head to Head round difference

**Group Matches:** 2 maps. Races to 11 on each map. 20 rounds max. You stop when a team hits 11 on a map. Think of it as two 'best of 1s' for each group match. Maps will be pre-picked (random on stream). You get 3 points per map win, 1 point for a map draw and 0 points for a loss.

**Match Format:** 2 maps (normal scrim), teams picking their own map. However a team can only pick a map once through the bracket stage. This resets in the finals. If you pick harbor in the first bracket match, that map is eliminated from your pool unless your opponent picks it versus you. You will bash for first map and bash for first side as normal.

* Round 1 - Harbor
* Round 2 - Railyard
* Round 3 - Hurtgen
